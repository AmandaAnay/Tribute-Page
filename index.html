            <h1>Brief History</h1>
            <h3>Queen's Origin and Family</h3>
            <p>Born in the city of Alexandria, Queen Cleopatra was descended from the Greek kings, 
                the Ptolemaics.</p>
            <p>The queen's ancestors were five hundred miles from Alexandria on the island of Filae. 
                Over 300 years, temples dedicated to the XII Ptolemies were built in this place. 
                Ptomoleus III was the last great pharaoh of the Ptolemaic era, he regained much of 
                the wealth he had lost to other civilizations. Already Ptolemy IV failed and lost much 
                of the riches of <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.educamaisbrasil.com.br/enem/historia/egito-antigo" 
                target="_blank">ancient Egypt. </a></p>
            <p>Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra's father, was known as the flute player. He lived playing the 
                small wind instrument, thus avoiding the government's responsibilities. At age 17, 
                Cleopatra saw her father pass away. In the will left, Ptolemy XII said that Egypt 
                should be ruled by Cleopatra and her brother, Ptolemy.</p>
            <h3>The Throne of Egypt</h3>
            <p>After her father's death in 51 BC, Cleopatra came to the throne of Egypt. As we have seen,
                Ptolemy XII left the kingdom to Ptolemy XIII and to Cleopatra, whom he was supposed to marry, 
                according to tradition. However, the monarchs were surrounded by court men who wanted power and who had some influence 
                over Cleopatra and her brother.</p>
            <p>Queen of Egypt always understood that Rome was the new power in the Mediterranean and 
                that in order to remain in power, she had to establish a friendly relationship with her. 
                Then, in 49 BC Cleopatra offered the Pompey triumvirate (political alliance) and sixty boats 
                to help fight Julius Caesar.</p>
            <p>Faced with this attitude, the advisers raised the possibility that Cleopatra wanted to rule 
                alone and then turned the people of Alexandria against her, who were forced to flee to southern 
                Egypt and then to Syria.</p>
                <h3>Cleopatra and Julius Caesar</h3>
                <p>Cleopatra then decided to join an army of mercenaries and returned to Egypt to fight 
                    her brother. However, the international scene underwent a change and on August 9, 48 BC, 
                    Caesar defeated Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalia, in Thessaly. Defeated, Pompey sought 
                    shelter in Alexandria and Ptolemy XIII agreed to receive him.</p>
                <p>Ptolemy XIII's real plan was to kill Pompey, believing that in this way he would please 
                    Caesar. Ptolemy XIII then hired a Roman to cut off Pompey's head, which was later presented 
                    to Caesar.</p>
                <p>This attitude was seen as a mistake, as Caesar was appalled by the barbaric attitude. 
                    Despite political enemies, Pompey was married to Caesar's daughter, who died in childbirth. 
                    Thus, Caesar took Alexandria and decided to resolve the war between Ptolemy XIII and 
                    Cleopatra.</p>
                <p>Cleopatra arranged a meeting with Julius Caesar when he arrived in Egypt, in the winter 
                    of 48 BC â€“ 49 BC, in order to present him with a rug. Unrolling the object, Caesar found 
                    the queen inside. Cleopatra said that she had been enchanted by Caesar's love stories and 
                    so had developed this plan to meet him. They have since become lovers, which has helped to 
                    establish their power in the country. </p>
                <p>To resolve the crisis in Egypt, Caesar confirmed what he had in Ptolemy XII's will and 
                    confirmed Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as co-rulers of Egypt. Caesar further proposed that 
                    Cleopatra's younger brothers, Arsinoe and Ptolemy XIV, leave the country and become rulers 
                    of Cyprus.</p>
                <p>Arsinoe was ambitious and had the army declare her Queen of Egypt. An officer began to 
                    oppose Arsinoe, she then had him killed and then her brother joined her.</p>
                <p>In 47 BC the Egyptian army was defeated by Caesar. Arsione became a prisoner and Ptolemy 
                    XIII drowned in the River Nile while trying to escape.In June of the same year, Cleopatra's son with Caesar was born. Although he acknowledged 
                    paternity, Caesar refused to make the child his heir. The post belonged to Octavian. </p>
                <p>The birth of Cleopatra's son brought benefits to Caesar. As the father of the heir to the 
                    throne of Egypt, he Caesar could guarantee the shipment of wheat to Rome without great 
                    financial loss. Julius Caesar and Cleopatra did not go up to the altar because Caesar 
                    was already married to another woman.</p>
                <h3>Relationship with Marcus Antonius</h3>
                <p>In Rome, the Second Triumvirate composed of Marcus Antonius, Octavius and Lepidus, organized the 
                    growth of Roman dominions towards the East. Marcus Antonius called Cleopatra for a meeting 
                    in the city of Cilicia. The Queen accepted the invitation and went in a boat all decked out in 
                    another and silver, to demonstrate the Egyptian power and wealth. Marcus Antonius fell in love 
                    with her, but returned to Rome to marry Octavia.
                <p>Marcus Antonius made Cleopatra queen of Syria, Cilicia, Cyprus, and Arabia. This act proved the 
                    wrath of Octavius who declared war on Cleopatra.</p>
                <p>Leading a powerful fleet, Octavius and General Agrippa defeated Marcus Antonius, who made it to 
                    the shores of Alexandria and thought he was dropped by Cleopatra. In this way he committed suicide 
                    with his sword.</p>
                <p>Besieged and slaughtered in the city of Alexandria, the queen decided to end her own life. 
                    Not satisfied, Octavius completely annihilated the line of succession of Cleopatra's heirs 
                    as well as turning Egypt into a mere province subordinate to representatives of the Roman 
                    power. Thus, the sign of loyalty represented by the military victory made Octavius the first 
                    Roman emperor.</p>
